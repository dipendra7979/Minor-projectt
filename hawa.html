        <h1>Hawa Mahal</h1>
        <p>Hawa Mahal, or the "Palace of Winds", is a palace in Jaipur, India. It was constructed in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singhand Ust, and designed by Lal Chad. Made of red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The palace was built to allow royal ladies to observe street festivities and everyday life without being seen, adhering to the strict rules of purdah in the royal household.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The five-story palace is famous for its intricate latticework, with 953 small windows (jharokhas) allowing a cool breeze to pass through, hence the name "Hawa Mahal". This cooling effect, combined with the unique design, made the palace a perfect retreat during Jaipur's hot summers.</p>
        
        <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
        <p>Hawa Mahal showcases a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture. The façade resembles a honeycomb of a beehive, with each window delicately ornamented. The top three floors of the palace are just one room deep, while the two lower floors have courtyards, a reflection of traditional Rajput styles of architecture.</p>
        
        <h2>Tourism & Legacy</h2>
        <p>Hawa Mahal is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jaipur. The palace, with its stunning architecture and historical significance, draws tourists from all over the world. Its proximity to the City Palace and Jantar Mantar makes it an essential part of Jaipur's cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="etymology">
            <span class="section-title">Etymology</span>
            <p>The name "Hawa Mahal" means "Palace of Winds" in Hindi. It is derived from the palace’s primary purpose: the many windows allowed breezes (hawa) to flow through the building, keeping it cool and comfortable, even during the hottest days of summer.</p>

        <div class="architecture">
            <span class="section-title">Architecture</span>
            <p>The palace is an outstanding example of Rajput architecture, featuring a unique five-story pyramidal shape. The façade is covered with intricate carvings and motifs, while the interiors are relatively simple. The combination of Mughal and Rajput styles creates a stunning contrast, making Hawa Mahal one of the architectural marvels of India.</p>
