        <h1>Victoria Memorial</h1>
        <p>The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Kolkata, India, dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria, and is now a museum and tourist destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. It was designed by William Emerson in an architectural style that blends Mughal and European elements, and was completed in 1921. The memorial stands as a symbol of the British Empire's influence in India and is one of Kolkata's most iconic landmarks.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The memorial is 184 feet tall and stands within 64 acres of gardens, modeled after the Taj Mahal in its vastness and grandeur. The marble structure is topped by a 16-foot tall bronze statue of Victory, which rotates with the wind. The Victoria Memorial is constructed of white Makrana marble and is considered one of the finest examples of colonial architecture in India.</p>
        
        <h2>History & Design</h2>
        <p>Construction of the Victoria Memorial was proposed by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, shortly after the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. It was meant to serve as a tribute to the Queen's reign and the British Raj in India. The foundation stone was laid in 1906, and the building was opened to the public in 1921. The architecture incorporates elements of the Renaissance, classical European design, and Mughal influences, creating a uniquely grand structure.</p>
        
        <h2>Significance & Legacy</h2>
        <p>As a symbol of British colonial power in India, the Victoria Memorial holds significant historical importance. The museum housed within the memorial contains numerous artifacts related to Queen Victoria and British India, including paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and historical documents. Today, the Victoria Memorial is one of Kolkata's most popular tourist attractions, with millions visiting annually to explore its museum and gardens.</p>

        <div class="etymology">
            <span class="section-title">Etymology</span>
            <p>The memorial was named after Queen Victoria, the monarch of the United Kingdom and the British Empire during a period of significant colonial expansion. The structure was designed to honor her legacy and the role she played as Empress of India, a title bestowed upon her in 1876 by the British Parliament.</p>
