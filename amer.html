        <p>The fort was originally built by Raja Man Singh I in the 16th century and expanded by his descendant Jai Singh I. The Amer Fort consists of four courtyards, palaces, halls, gardens, and temples. Notable structures include the Diwan-e-Aam, the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace.</p>

        <h2>History & Significance</h2>
        <p>Amer was the capital of the Kachwaha Rajputs before Jaipur was built. The fortâ€™s construction started in 1592 under Raja Man Singh I, one of Akbar's trusted generals. The fort was later developed by successive rulers over the next 150 years. Amer Fort has been the seat of power for the Rajput rulers and has seen many political and military movements throughout its history.</p>
        
        <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
        <p>Amer Fort is a grand example of Rajput architecture with its massive courtyards, staircases, and gates. The fort is known for its stunning carvings, beautiful frescoes, intricate mirror work, and extensive use of marble and red sandstone. One of the key attractions is the Ganesh Pol, a magnificent gateway adorned with paintings of Lord Ganesh.</p>

        <div class="etymology">
