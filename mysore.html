        <p>The current palace was built between 1897 and 1912 after the old wooden palace was destroyed by fire.

        <h2>History & Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Mysore Palace was initially constructed in the 14th century, but the current structure was commissioned by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV in 1897 after the previous palace was burned down. The architect Henry Irwin designed the new palace, combining elements of traditional Indian, Indo-Saracenic, and European architecture. The palace is known for its domes, turrets, arches, and colonnades, giving it a majestic appearance. The palace's vibrant colors and elaborate decorations are especially stunning during the annual Dasara festival.</p>
        
        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>

The palace is illuminated with nearly 100,000 lights during the festival, creating a breathtaking spectacle. It also serves as a symbol of the rich cultural heritage of Karnataka and the legacy of the Wadiyar dynasty, who played a vital role in the development of the region.</p>
