        <h1>Qutub Minar</h1>
        <p>The Qutub Minar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Mehrauli, Delhi, India. It is a soaring, 73-meter tall tower built in 1193 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, marking the beginning of Muslim rule in India. The tower is known for its tapering structure, red sandstone walls, and intricate carvings, which make it one of the finest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Qutub Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world, composed of five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony. It was built to celebrate the victory of the Muslim empire in Delhi, and the minaret's ornate designs reflect the architectural brilliance of its time. The surrounding Qutub complex is also home to other historical monuments, including the Alai Darwaza, the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, and the Iron Pillar.</p>
        
        <h2>History & Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Qutub Minar was commissioned by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, and was completed by his successor, Iltutmish. Each level of the minar is intricately decorated with Quranic inscriptions and geometric patterns. The first three storeys are built with red sandstone, while the fourth and fifth storeys are made of marble and sandstone. The Qutub Minar is an excellent blend of Afghan and local Indian styles, creating a unique monument that stands as a symbol of cultural synthesis.</p>
        
        <h2>Significance & Legacy</h2>
        <p>As one of the most iconic monuments in India, Qutub Minar is not only a testament to the architectural mastery of the time but also holds significant historical importance. It was part of the larger Qutub Complex, which was the first city of Delhi. The minaret has withstood the test of time, enduring multiple earthquakes and restorations, but it still remains a symbol of India’s rich history and cultural diversity. The complex attracts millions of visitors each year and remains one of Delhi’s top tourist attractions.</p>

        <div class="etymology">
            <span class="section-title">Etymology</span>
            <p>The name "Qutub Minar" is derived from the Arabic word "Qutb," meaning "axis" or "pole." It is believed to be named after Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who laid the foundation of the structure. The tower was also meant to serve as a minaret from which the muezzin could call the faithful to prayer at the adjacent Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque.</p>
