        <h1>Gateway of India</h1>
        <p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1911. The monument was later used as a ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and new Governors of Bombay. Today, the Gateway of India is one of Mumbai's most iconic landmarks and a popular tourist destination.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The structure, designed in the Indo-Saracenic style, blends elements of both Hindu and Muslim architectural styles. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913, and the structure was completed in 1924. The arch is 26 meters (85 feet) high and is situated on the waterfront in the Apollo Bunder area, overlooking the Arabian Sea.</p>
        
        <h2>History & Significance</h2>
        <p>The Gateway of India holds great historical significance as it marked the arrival of the British monarchy in India. It was from this gateway that the last British troops left India in 1948, following India's independence. The monument has since stood as a symbol of both India's colonial past and its eventual independence. It remains one of the key locations in the city for major public gatherings and events.</p>
        
        <h2>Architectural Design</h2>
        <p>The design of the Gateway of India was prepared by the Scottish architect George Wittet. Its central dome is 15 meters in diameter and reaches a height of 26 meters, while the overall design reflects a mix of Hindu temple architecture and Islamic Mughal elements. The yellow basalt and reinforced concrete structure has been preserved and maintained as a national heritage site.</p>

        <div class="etymology">
            <span class="section-title">Etymology</span>
            <p>The name "Gateway of India" signifies its role as the ceremonial entrance point to India for British officials and dignitaries during the colonial era. It was intended to represent the grandeur and authority of the British Empire, while also paying homage to the rich cultural heritage of the subcontinent through its architectural blend.</p>

        <div class="history">
            <span class="section-title">Historical Moments</span>
            <p>The most significant historical event associated with the Gateway of India is the departure of British forces from India after the country gained independence in 1947. On 28 February 1948, the last of the British troops ceremoniously exited India through the arch, symbolizing the end of British rule and the dawn of a new era for the nation.</p>
